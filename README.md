# Breath of the Wild Compenium

## Summary

This is a mobile-first, responsive web application that will fetch data from gadhagod's Hyrule Compendium API. My approach to this application will be functionality first, visuals last. The stack being used is TypeScript, React, and SASS. This application also serves as practice with TDD. Jest is being used for component testing.

Thanks to gadhagod for their API. [https://github.com/gadhagod/Hyrule-Compendium-API]

## Goals

The goal for this project is to practice building component based UIs with TypeScript and React.
